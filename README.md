1. Added alt tags to all images to provide better access for search engines.
2. Changed all divs with other HTML semantic elements to provide clear identyfiers for easier reading of the code.
3. Combined certain css styling to cut back on reused code.
4. Fixed functionality issue with Search Engine Optimization button that was not taken user to correct portion of page when clicked.
5. Added notes throughout code to help future developers.
